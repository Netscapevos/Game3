Game Objective

The goal of the game is to draw a line that is just the right size:

Big Enough: To cross the gap between platforms.

Not Too Big: So it doesn’t overshoot the platform.

It’s a fun and challenging game that tests your precision and judgment skills.

How the Game Was Made

This game was created using:

HTML

CSS

JavaScript

The idea and implementation were inspired by a tutorial on YouTube. The game concept is based on a similar game available in the app store.

Limitations

Unfortunately, this code only works in CodePen. If you try running it locally, it won’t function as expected. I tried running it locally first, but it didn’t work.

How to Play

Open the project in CodePen.

Use the game interface to draw a line.

Try to get the line to cross the gap without overshooting the platform.

Enjoy the game and have fun mastering the challenge!
